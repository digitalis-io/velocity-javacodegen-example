# velocity-javacodegen-example
Very very very simple application showing how to use Velocity to generate code.

1 - Checkout the project

2 - Open it in Intellij (or whatever)

3 - Run the Main file in the jar-with-dependencies submodule. It will read in the template in resources and output the java file to the generated code project as a new file.

Enjoy!
